# MLE/VAE for nonlinear ICA

## Data Generation
Distribution of the latent variable `z` and the generated `x`. 
- **Column**: Distribution of `z`, `x` with `ReLU` activation, `x` with `Sigmoid` activation, `x` with `Tanh` activation and `x` with `GELU` activation.  
- **Row**: Distribution of `z, x` with `m=1, n=1`, `m=1, n=2` and `m=2, n=2`
